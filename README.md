# Stats-141 Class:
### Course Description
Opportunity to solve real data analysis problems for real community-based or campus-based clients. Students work in small groups with faculty member and client to frame clientâ€™s question in statistical terms, create statistical model, analyze data, and report results. Weekly meetings in classroom setting to study basic consulting skills, share experiences, exchange ideas, and make reports.

As data explorers, we were assigned to work with Michael Thomas, a reading and writing professor at UCLA Extension whose specialty is teaching for international students. Given a dataset of 34 .csv files including 145 students' responses to Enrollment, Course Preferences, and Program Evaluations, a team of four members in the class used ggplot and wordcloud and textmining packages in R to visually represent and present interesting findings to the Professor at the end of the course.
